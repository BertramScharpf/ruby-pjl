# WARNING! The filter-path capability "fp" below is an extension
# written by me and filed in December 2015
# (<https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=205604>).
# The FreeBSD community is ignoring my proposal as diligently as possible.
#
# The problem: After lpd was started by the "service" command (not
# /etc/rc.d/lpd from the command line!) the PATH environment variable
# is set as in /etc/login.conf. If the filter is a Ruby script containing
# a shebang line calling "env", the interpreter maybe will not be found.
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
#
# Possible solutions:
#
#   - Patch your base system and "make buildworld" etc. again.
#
#   - Replace the shebang line using an explicit path:
#
#       #!/usr/local/bin/ruby
#
#   - Set an extended PATH variable for the lpd daemon in /etc/rc.conf:
#
#       lpd_enable="YES"
#       lpd_env="PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
#
#   - Check the path capability in /etc/login.conf.
#
# Good luck!
